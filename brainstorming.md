## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Anime catalogue with Search Feature
   - **Description:** An anime catalogue with search features, displays a few categories in the home pages like shonen,romance,ect.
   - **Category:** Social Networking, Entertainment, and Cataloging.
   - **Mobile:** The app would work better then a website so that if we wanted we could add push notifcitations to keep users updated on new anime releases as well as making it more convenient as a an app instead on a website.
   - **Story:** Users can browse and manage their anime catalog, discover trending shows, take quizzes, and connect with other anime fans.
   - **Habit:** Users could frequently return to track their progress, explore recommendations, or engage in discussions. The inclusion of personality quizzes and user-generated lists makes the app even more engaging.
   - **Scope:** Moderate to large since the base features of a catalog with search features is achievable. I think the biggest issue will be learing how the api works.
   - **Market:** Large; We have a large market since the app would provide significant value to any group of anime enjoyers.
